# Notes Application

## Summary

[//]: # (TODO Provide summary description.)

Noted is a note taking mobile application. Noted allows users to create notes that they would 
like to save and go back to so that they can review the notes that they have taken previously.
Each user can create tasks aka todo's to add to certain dates so that they can have a list 
of tasks that they wanted to keep track of as well that might coencide with a note or activity
that they are doing on a particular day. A user can also create reminders to set in the future
that will give them a countdown of how many days left until that reminder is due as well as 
being a daily reminder up until that date has come because of the frustration that some people
have with other reminder apps that only notify them when that date has come and not up until 
that day has come. The user also has the ability to update or delete any of these notes, tasks, 
or reminders..
